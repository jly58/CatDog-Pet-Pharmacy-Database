Welcome to the Cat Dog pharmacy app! CatDog-Pet-Pharmacy is a Python Flask web application using a MySQL backend, designed to streamline pet pharmaceutical services. It tracks annual prescriptions, revenue, frequently prescribed medications, and veterinary clinic activity. The site also stores contact details and pet demographic data. For simplicity, medication costs are calculated per prescription and records of inactive clients are removed to ensure privacy.
